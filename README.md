从程序员转行卖烧饼想到IT人创业
From programmers to burgers to IT Entrepreneurship
我的一个朋友最近总在跟我念叨着我不想做开发了，整天累死累活写程序，也攒不下几个钱。我想辞职搞点啥!
A friend of mine has been telling me recently that I don't want to do development. I've been writing programs all day and I can't save much money. I want to quit and do something!
我问他：你想搞点啥?
I asked him: What do you want to do?
他说：搞啥都比做开发强，做个网站赚广告费，接私活实在不行我去卖烧饼去，你没看到《网游程序员转行卖烧饼：月入2万买房娶靓妹》 这个新闻吗?没看到《IT工程师放弃20万年薪去开奶茶铺边卖奶茶》这样的新闻吗?NND，卖烧饼、卖奶茶都比干程序员有前途呀!
He said: What is better than development, make a website to earn advertising fees, take personal work is really not good for me to sell pancakes, you did not see the "online game programmers to sell pancakes: 20,000 a month to buy a house to marry beautiful girls" this news? Didn't you see the "IT engineers give up 200,000 years salary to start milk tea shop to sell milk tea" such news? Cakes and milk tea are more promising than dry programmers.
那你也想去卖烧饼?
So you want to sell pancakes, too?
不卖烧饼，太累，而且还会被城管追着跑。我想开个眼镜店，现在眼镜是暴利呀，一副镜框进价20块钱，一转手卖给咱们就三四百!
Not selling pancakes, too tired, and will be chased by city management. I want to open an optician's shop. Now the spectacles are profitable. A pair of frames costs 20 yuan. Once sold to us, they will be three or four hundred!
先暂且放下我这个朋友的事情不表，我来跟各位朋友讲讲我卖奶茶的经历。没听错，自诩为年薪百万的.Net讲师的杨中科、很多人都说是看我的编程视频教程长大的的杨中科也卖过奶茶?
Let's put aside my friend's business for a moment. Let me tell you about my experience of selling milk tea. Yes, I'm right. Yang Zhongke, a lecturer on Net, and many people say that Yang Zhongke, who grew up watching my programming video tutorial, also sells milk tea?
事情是这样的，我爱人和其他女人一样，开一个自己的小店是她的梦想，为了满足她的这个梦想，我今年先后帮她开了两个加盟店，一个国内规模最大的发饰品店(问问你身边的女性朋友哪个品牌卖发卡终身免费盘发，她们应该知道)，一个门店数量200多的奶茶店(绿色门头，买八倍送一杯，也许你也猜出来了)。
The thing is, like other women, my wife's dream is to open her own shop. In order to meet her dream, I have opened two franchise stores for her this year, one of the largest hair accessories stores in China. (Ask your female friends which brand sells hair cards for free for life, they should You know, a milk tea shop with more than 200 stores (green door, buy eight times as much as a cup, maybe you guessed it).
奶茶店刚开张的前几天里，每天下班后我就赶去店里帮着发宣传单拉客，对着来来往往的人群一遍遍的喊奶茶买一送一，还自己即兴编了很多打油诗当广告词，从下午6点一直喊道晚上11点多打烊，多亏了我是讲师出身，嗓子一点事都没有。
A few days before the opening of the milk tea shop, I rushed to the shop every day after work to help send out leaflets to solicit customers, to the people who came and went repeatedly shouting milk tea to buy one free one, but also improvised a lot of oil poems as advertising words, from 6 p.m. has been shouting that 11 p.m. closing, thanks to my lecturer origin, voice. Nothing at all.
好吧，不说废话了，来给大家分析一下这家店的收入，工作日的时候一天能卖到大约70多杯，每杯平均7元钱，周末的时候一天能卖到大约90杯。这么一说，有人会惊呼杨中科，你老婆也白富美了呀，这样下来一个月收入岂不是有(70*7*5+90*7*2)*4= 14840这么多收入了，比我上班强多了，我也卖奶茶去。
Okay, don't talk nonsense, let's analyze the income of this store. It can sell about 70 cups a day during the working day, with an average of 7 yuan per cup, and about 90 cups a day at the weekend. In this way, some people will exclaim that Yang Zhongke, your wife is also white and rich, so next month's income is not (70*7*5+90*7*2)*4= 14840 so much income, much better than I go to work, I also sell milk tea.
先别激动了，这1.4W只是收入，干什么事情都是有成本的，我来算一下成本，奶茶的原料成本大约是30%，这个店的房租加水电费一个月是3500(在城中村里，所以房租比较便宜)，这样一个店的利润就是14840*(1-0.3)-3500=6888元。你还想说点啥，除了说这个数字挺吉利之外?而且这还是我爱人一个人一周七天工作，每天早上9点就奔去店里煮奶茶原浆，一直工作到晚上23点的收入。忙的时候一个人忙不过来而且要考虑自己临时有事来不了，
Don't get excited. This 1.4W is just income. Everything is cost. Let me calculate the cost. The raw material cost of milk tea is about 30%. The rent of this store plus water and electricity is 3500 per month (in the village in the city, so the rent is cheaper). The profit of such a store is 14840* (1-0.3) - 3500 = 6888 yuan. What else do you want to say, besides the lucky number? And it's my wife who works seven days a week and goes to the store every morning at 9 o'clock to cook milk tea pulp, working until 23 o'clock at night. When you are busy, you can't come alone and you have to consider that you can't come temporarily.
